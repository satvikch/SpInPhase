% Process to execute:
% 
% 1.   To install the package, download BM3D Matlab software from (if not working in the codebase) 
%     
%      http://www.cs.tut.fi/~foi/GCF-BM3D/BM3D.zip
%
%      and unzip it to the BM3D folder.
%
%
% 2.   Run setup.m before using the package.  
%      Setup  adds the  used paths  to the  search path. 
%
%
% 2. The main algorithm is SpInPHASE and is coded in SpInPHASE.m
%
% 3.  Other algorithms used by SpInPHASE
%
%     a)  Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)  -   OMP_C.m
%     b)  Online Dictionary Learning (ODL)   -   DicLearningM.m
%     c)  SpaRSAL                            - SpaRSAL/SpaRSAL.m
      d) ISpInPhase - 1 (MCP)                - SparSAL/thresh.m
      e) ISpInPhase - 2 (SCAD)               - SparSAL/Sthresh.m
      
% For ISpInPhase 1 & 2 output, uncomment the respective code in the SparSAL.m file for the corresponding regularizer.

% 4  Experiments reproducing the results in the paper.

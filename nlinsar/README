This MATLAB software implements the InSAR estimator (NL-InSAR)
from pair of coregistered SLC SAR images as presented in: "NL-InSAR : Non-Local
Interferogram Estimation", C.A. Deledalle, L.Denis and F. Tupin, IEEE Trans. on
Geoscience and Remote Sensing (to appear).

This software is free and should be used only for nonprofit purposes. Any
unauthorized use of this software for industrial or profit-oriented
activities is expressively prohibited.

The program has been written for MATLAB with the ImageProcessing Toolbox and the
Statistics Toolbox for Linux 32-bit or 64-bit and Windows 32-bit.

The following program files are present:

- nlInSAR.mex*:
  A Mex function wich performs one iteration of nlInSAR with given filtering
  parameters, and pre-estimated images.

- nlinsar.m:
  A matlab function wich calls iteratively the nlInSAR.mex*
  program to refine the estimation.

- example_nlinsar.m:
  An example of how to use the NL-InSAR filter. It denoises a simulated noisy
  images obtained from the House image (house.png) which jointly follows the
  Goodman's model of InSAR data. The set of parameters are the same as
  those given in the corresponding paper.

- insarrnd.m:
  Generates InSAR noisy data

- snr.m:
  Computes the SNR value.

- isnr.m:
  Computes the ISNR value.

- plotimage_insar.m:
  Plot three images corresponding to the channels of (estimated) noise-free
  InSAR data.
